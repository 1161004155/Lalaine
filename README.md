### UI Automation

Macaca offers automation drivers, environment support, peripheral tools, and integration solutions to tackle challenges such as test automation and client-side performance.In addition, we configure NoSmoke, a cross-platform UI crawler that scans view trees, performs OCR operations, and generates and executes UI test cases.

### Sensive API Hooking
